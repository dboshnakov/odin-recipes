    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Making the meatballs</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First prepare the meatballs – add to the meat onion, egg and all the spices. Mix everything well and with wet hands form balls – usually they are the size of a ping pong ball.</li>
            <li>Roll them in flour, so they are thoroughly covered. According to our culinary tradition, if the minced meat mix is too sticky at this point, you can add some bread crumbs – for this quantity a slice of bread will be enough.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Making the tomato sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a big heavy-based saucepan heat the oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>First add onion and garlic and gently fry them until just wilted, for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add diced pepper, stir and fry for 2-3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Take off the fire, add paprika and stir well – this is made to avoid burning the paprika.</li>
            <li>Pour in the hot stock, add celeriac and potatoes (if used) and return on medium heat.</li>
            <li>In another saucepan heat salted water.</li>
            <li>When hot, but not vigorously boiling add the meatballs and boil for just  5 minutes and take them out with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are almost done, in about 7-8 minutes, add meatballs and tomatoes and cook for 10 more minutes</li>
            <li>Before serving add fresh herbs</li>
            <li>Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
