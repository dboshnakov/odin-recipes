    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>vegetable or olive oil</li>
            <li>ground meat (I used a mix of ground 85% lean beef and ground pork)</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>tomato paste</li>

            <li>summer savory (or chubritsa – Bulgarian/Balkan seasoning)</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>carrots (optional, I usually don’t use any)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet. Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it down with a wooden spoon for 6-7 minutes, until browned. Add onion and garlic. Add carrots (optional).Add salt, black pepper, dried mint, summer savory, thyme (optional), tomato sauce and tomato paste. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9×9 or 9×13 baking dish with oil.</li>
        <li>Add in the drained potatoes and meat mixture. Stir to evenly distribute the meat into the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add cold water to the baking dish, so it just covers the top of the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes, until the water is absorbed by the potatoes and they are fully cooked.</li>
        <li>In the mean time prepare the Bechamel sauce (or the Bulgarian Style Topping).</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>For the Bechamel sauce</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, swish egg yolks. Add feta cheese, if using any. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan. add flour. Cook for 2 minutes on medium heat, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk, whisking to incorporate. Add salt and nutmeg. Cook for 3 minutes, until thickened. Let the mixture cool for 5 minutes. Add in the egg yolks (with feta). Let the sauce stand at room temperature, while the potatoes and meat are cooking.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the cooked potatoes. Top with cheese. Bake for 15 minutes, until golden. You can broil for 1-2 minutes, if the top is not getting to the desired golden color.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>For the Bulgarian Moussaka topping:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl beat together eggs, yogurt, milk, flour, then add salt and baking soda.</li>
